# requires ids for actionable elements (require-ids-for-actionable-elements)

.


## Rule Details

For certain testing reasons the inclusion of an id tag for html elements is helpful, e.g finding:
```js

<a> Link </a>
```
could be very difficult, however finding:

```js

<a id="WelcomeButtonLink"> Link </a>

```
would be consistent and easy.
